## Using the Kinvey Backend
The following section describes where to look in the code for examples of common backend tasks.

### User management
* `- [CreateAccountViewController createNewAccount:]` goes through the process of adding a new user to the users collection for a Kinvey-powered application. 
* `- [LoginViewContoller login:]` provides an example of using the `KCSUser` class to verify input credentials.
* `- [LoginViewContoller loginWithFacebook:]` provides an example of using the Facebook SDK obtain a Facebook session token an log in to Kinvey with it.


### Data caching and linking
Class `DataHelper` provides data caching and linking management
It contains Stores for Quotes, Orders and Products
Storages are `KCSLinkedAppdataStore` with a cache policy: `KCSCachePolicyNetworkFirst`, this means that at first data will be save on Backend.

### View controllers
View controllers able to use `DataHelper` methods with cached data and data from network
* The `QuoteHomeViewController` uses `DataHelper`'s method `- (void)loadOrdersUseCache:(BOOL)useCache containtSubstinrg:(NSString *)substring OnSuccess:(void (^)(NSArray *))reportSuccess onFailure:(STErrorBlock)reportFailure;` method and can manipulate how to fetch data with `(BOOL)useCache`
